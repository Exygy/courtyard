- [ ] Check for accessibility (contrast, tabbing, etc)

- [ ] Did you check for existing methods for icons, images, other - before creating new ones

- [ ] When a template imports a child template, make sure the child is rendering data passed from the parent, not the default data of the child.

- [ ] Components intended for inline text (Content templates) need to be able to accept dynamic ids for js functionality or have some other method for ensuring multiples on the same page don’t fail.  For example id="read-more-${randomId}"
