# JCC Design System

Based on the [Pattern Lab Twig Standard Edition for Drupal](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-php-drupal-standard).

## Prerequisites

- [`composer`](https://getcomposer.org) installed globally
- Node v12.x.x

## Getting Started

1. `git clone https://github.com/Exygy/courtyard.git` to create the project directory.
2. `cd courtyard` to go to the directory.
3. `composer install` to install Pattern Lab.
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run start` to generate the pattern library, watch for changes, and serve the pattern library on `localhost` at a port that will be specified in the command's console output.

## Before Committing

As `npm run start` is optimized for local development before making a commit minified css for srl and trial need to be generated by running `npm run build`

## Pattern Lab Theme

Multiple themes are available for the pattern lab and are being developed over time. These themes are generated into different css sheets to be used in different Drupal instances.
The major themes are:

1. SRL
2. Trial Courts

(to be developed) Trail Courts contain color palette options.

### Generating Themes

When developing these theme use separate npm commands to generate different stylesheets through gulp.js to cut down on load times.

SRL
`npm run srl` to generate the SRL themed pattern library, watch for changes, and serve the pattern library on `localhost`.

Trial Court
`npm run trial` to generate the Trial Court themed pattern library, watch for changes, and serve the pattern library on `localhost`.

All themes
`npm run start` to refresh all versions of the themed pattern library, watch for changes, and serve the pattern library on `localhost`.

You can select between these themes in the top left corners section panel.

1. SRl
2. Trial Courts
3. Trial Courts Purple - takes a sec to load (JS front-end Primary Color Replacement)

### Theme Development

General Theme Development
To develop a new theme copy the gulp processes, generate a style sheet, duplicate the base theme in protons and then change your variables accordingly.

Component Theming
When making changes to components in the pattern library use sass variables referenced in /css scss files to overwrite scss and turn functionality off and on. SRL will be used as the base styling for components. For example:

Theming is currently in development. Feel free to ask Ivan from JCC or Evan from Exygy with questions.

## To update Pattern Lab

    composer update

## Deployment

You can view a public deployment of the pattern library at https://confident-allen-d061ed.netlify.com/. This is hosted on an Exygy Netlify account. The Netlify deployment autodeploys the master branch from this repo. Each time a commit is pushed to the master branch, Netlify will run the `npm run build` command to build the pattern library, and it will then deploy that new build from the `public` directory.

Netlify will also create a preview deployment for each PR created in this repo. To view the preview deployment for a PR, go to the PR and scroll down to the bottom to the checks section. In that section, there is a list item for the deploy preview. Click the "Details" link in that list item to view the deploy preview (see below image).

### Courtyard Artifact

Commits to the courtyard project main branch also trigger a build and deployment to the courtyard-artifact. This is a light weight composer package that can be included in Drupal or other PHP based projects.

*See Drupal/PHP Integration below, for more information.*

### Code Style

We use the automatic code formatter Prettier. If you use an IDE such as Sublime Text, VSCode, or similar, you can likely add a Prettier extension that will autoformat your files using Prettier rules on file save. If you're not using an IDE that integrates with it, you should run `npx prettier --write [filepath]` on all added or changed files before you submit a pull request.


## Drupal/PHP Integration

Drupal or other PHP based projects should use: `composer require judicialcouncil/courtyard-artifact`

https://packagist.org/packages/judicialcouncil/courtyard-artifact

The courtyard-artifact package is designated type: drupal-library. You can set library path in your composer.json like the following for a drupal project:

```
"extra": {
    "installer-paths": {
        "web/core": [
            "type:drupal-core"
        ],
        "web/libraries/{$name}": [
            "type:drupal-library"
        ]
    }
}
```
** Adapt for other types of PHP projects.

If you need to sync local changes to courtyard to your project library for development purposes, the following bash aliases might be helpful to add to your .bashrc or .bash_profile. Update path variables as needed.

```
path_courtyard="~/Sites/courtyard"
path_project_library="~/Sites/trialcourt"
alias ctbuild="(cd $path_courtyard && npm run build)"
alias ctsync="ctbuild && rsync -KPar --delete --force --include=/{'public/***','source/***'} --exclude='*' $path_courtyard/ $path_project_library/web/libraries/courtyard-artifact"
alias ctrestore="(cd $path_trialcourt && rm -rf web/libraries/courtyard-artifact && composer install)"
```

 - `ctbuild` - Build courtyard assets.
 - `ctsync` - Build assets and sync to project library.
 - `ctrestore` - Remove synced dev changes and reinstall courtyard-artifact.
