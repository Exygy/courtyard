            Always confirm the terms of an agreement in writing. Often a settlement will be put into
            a written settlement agreement. If the debt collector prepares the settlement agreement,
            read it very carefully, and be sure that you understand and agree to any terms in the
            settlement before you sign. You are allowed to consult an attorney before signing any
            settlement agreement.
